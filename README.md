DTRW
====

Simulations of continuous time random walks (CTRWs) and factional partial differential equations through the discrete time random walk (DTRW) method. The theory and methods are outlined in a paper in the Journal of Computaional Physics: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199911400549X

This repository contains code that replicates results in several papers, currently in preparation. The publication list will be updated shortly.
